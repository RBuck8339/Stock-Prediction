# Stock-Prediction
Project for me to learn Time Series Machine Learning and specifically forecasting
Using the Alpha Vantage API, create a mostly accurate machine learning model to predict future stock prices

# Goals: 
- Test different Time Series models to see what has the best accuracy
- Learn front end development by creating a front end that can interact with the model
- Deploy the model using Docker or some other deployment tool
- Potentially: Create my own foundational model inspired by Google's TimesFM


# Current Progress: 
- None
